# Product Guidelines: KnowWhere Memory

## Voice and Tone
- **Friendly & Personal:** Our communication should feel like a helpful companion. Use accessible language and a supportive tone.
- **Clear & Transparent:** While being friendly, we must remain precise about data handling and security. Use simple explanations for complex AI concepts.
- **Empowering:** Focus on how the tool helps the user grow and remember, rather than just the technology itself.

## Visual Identity (Placeholder)
- **Aesthetic:** Clean, modern, and approachable. Avoid overly "techy" or cold designs.
- **Colors:** Warm and inviting palettes (e.g., soft blues, teals, or greens) that evoke a sense of calm and reliability.
- **Typography:** Sans-serif fonts that are highly legible and have a friendly character.

## Principles
- **Privacy First:** Every design and feature decision must prioritize user privacy and data ownership.
- **Context is King:** The UI should help users understand *why* a memory was retrieved or *how* it was extracted.
- **Frictionless Utility:** The best memory is one you don't have to think about. Automate where possible, but always allow for manual override.
